This folder contains the codebases for each chapter of [our book](https://builderbook.org/books/builder-book/introduction), which teaches you how to build the entire Builder Book web app from scratch.

In each chapter, you'll begin with the `start` folder and build up to the `end` folder for that chapter. In total, you'll go from 0 lines of code in Chapter 1 to over 12,000 lines of code in Chapter 9.
